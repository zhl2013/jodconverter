libjodconverter-java for Debian
-------------------------------

See http://www.artofsolving.com/opensource/jodconverter for the latest documentation.

Before you can perform any conversions you need to start OpenOffice.org
in listening mode on port 8100 as described in the JODConverter Guide.

As a quick start you can type from a command line

  soffice -headless -accept="socket,port=8100;urp;"
